For each button you may use only a single <a> tag, with as many <span> tags as you need.

Do as much as you can in the time you have.

When you have finished email your completed file(s) to foobar@maqe.com.

You may use the internet to look up any HTML or CSS references, but do not ask anyone else for assistance.
